# ADS Assignment â€“ Data Structures Implementation

This project contains custom implementations of core data structures using Java:
- ArrayList
- LinkedList
- Stack
- Queue
- MinHeap

## Time Complexity

| Structure      | Operation         | Time Complexity |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| ArrayList      | add/remove        | O(1) / O(n)     |
| LinkedList     | add/remove        | O(1) / O(1)     |
| Stack          | push/pop          | O(1)            |
| Queue          | enqueue/dequeue   | O(1)            |
| MinHeap        | insert/delete     | O(log n)        |

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Run the `Main.java` file inside each structure's folder
3. Observe expected outputs in the console

## What I Learned
- Implementing data structures manually
- Differences between dynamic arrays and linked lists
- Using generics and iterators
- Organizing code in a clean object-oriented way
- Working with Git and GitHub

## Version Control
Code is committed in parts as each structure is implemented. GitHub history shows step-by-step development.

## Conclusion
This assignment improved my understanding of how classic data structures work under the hood and strengthened my coding and debugging skills in Java.
